Installation
============

Bottom supports **Python 3.5+**.

Bottom depends on simplex_, a module that offers a simpler interface to pattern
matching, but with significantly reduced capabilities.

To get everything set up, run::

    pip install bottom

.. _simplex: https://github.com/numberoverzero/simplex
